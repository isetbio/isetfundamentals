%% Virtual channel conceptual
%
% The virtual channel concept differs from the conventional method of
% finding a linear transformation.  This script experiments with ways to
% demonstrate how they differ.
%
% In words, when we find a linear transform from A to B, we always find a
% channel that is within the space of A to match a channel in B. If B is
% outside of the space spanned by A, we will find the 'closets' channel in
% A to a channel in B.
%
% With the virtual channel approach, we ask whether there exists a weighted
% sum of the A channels (virtual-A) that is close to a weighted sum of B
% channels (vitual-B).  Neither of these virtual channels exists in the
% device itself.  But the two virtual channels might still be found that
% match very closely.
