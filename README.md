[Deriving the cone fundamentals: a subspace intersection method](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.04.577470v1)

Two ideas, proposed by Thomas Young and James Clerk Maxwell, form the foundations of color science: (1) Three types of retinal receptors encode light under daytime conditions, and (2) color matching experiments establish the critical spectral properties of this encoding. Experimental quantification of these ideas are used in international color standards. But, for many years the field did not reach consensus on the spectral properties of the biological substrate of color matching: the sensitivity of the in situ cones (cone fundamentals). By combining auxiliary data (thresholds, inert pigment analyses), complex calculations, and color matching from genetically analyzed dichromats, the human cone fundamentals have now been standardized.

Here we describe a new computational method to estimate the cone fundamentals using only color matching from dichromatic observers. We show that it is not necessary to include data from trichromatic observers in the analysis or to know the primary lights used in the matching experiments. Remarkably, it is even possible to estimate the fundamentals by combining data from experiments using different, unknown primaries. We then suggest how the new method may be applied to color management in modern image systems.
We have an insight about how to estimate the cone fundamentals from the color matching functions.  The method differs somewhat from those in the literature, relying on simple linear algebraic calculations.
