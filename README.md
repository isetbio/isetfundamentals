# isetfundamentals

We have an insight about how to estimate the cone fundamentals from the color matching functions.  The method differs somewhat from those in the literature, relying on simple linear algebraic calculations.

The scripts here simulate the method.  They also take a long-run historical view, including analysis of the earliest color matching functions from J.C. Maxwell and dichromatic CMFs from Wright.

Have a look at the wiki (https://github.com/isetbio/isetfundamentals/wiki).  We are keeping this ReadMe short.  The wiki will grow.
