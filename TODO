**InfoHTML:**

**Introduce Maxwell's color theory**
- Based on one color only; thus, no spatial relationship
- Biological perception of superposition of 3 color primaries to match another sample color
    - proves trichromacy for human biological perception (we see 3 pieces of information)
+ Add Koh Terai's demos

**Measuring of light (biological and mechanical)**
- Maxwell observed only physiological perception of physical light
- Physical and continuous light is a superposition of all its frequencies into a wave
- Light perception can retrieve the _fundamentals_ (for biology, LMS, and for camera, RGB)
- Light perception _cannot_ retrieve light-frequencies
    - fundamental = Conversion X light-frequencies
    - LMS = [...L(gamma)...] [E400]
    -       [...M(gamma)...] [...]
    -       [...S(gamma)...] [E700]
+ Add diagrams/interactives

**Conversion between fundamentals**
- ISET Fundamentals explores the conversion matrices (defined above) between color spaces
+ Add interactive to calculate and convert between fundamentals

**Spatial information in color encoding**
- One major factor that Maxwell's research is limited by is the position of colors in regards to biological perception
- For the human eye, what the fovea sees is also dependent on the color content around the position of the fovea's focus
- This is the cause of most color illusions
